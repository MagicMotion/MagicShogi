/*! \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 * For many large applications C++ is the language of choice and so it seems
 * reasonable to define C++ bindings for OpenCL.
 *
 * The interface is contained with a single C++ header file \em cl2.hpp and all
 * definitions are contained within the namespace \em cl. There is no additional
 * requirement to include \em cl.h and to use either the C++ or original C
 * bindings; it is enough to simply include \em cl2.hpp.
 *
 * The bindings themselves are lightweight and correspond closely to the
 * underlying C API. Using the C++ bindings introduces no additional execution
 * overhead.
 *
 * There are numerous compatibility, portability and memory management
 * fixes in the new header as well as additional OpenCL 2.0 features.
 * As a result the header is not directly backward compatible and for this
 * reason we release it as cl2.hpp rather than a new version of cl.hpp.
 * 
 *
 * \section compatibility Compatibility
 * Due to the evolution of the underlying OpenCL API the 2.0 C++ bindings
 * include an updated approach to defining supported feature versions
 * and the range of valid underlying OpenCL runtime versions supported.
 *
 * The combination of preprocessor macros CL_HPP_TARGET_OPENCL_VERSION and 
 * CL_HPP_MINIMUM_OPENCL_VERSION control this range. These are three digit
 * decimal values representing OpenCL runime versions. The default for 
 * the target is 200, representing OpenCL 2.0 and the minimum is also 
 * defined as 200. These settings would use 2.0 API calls only.
 * If backward compatibility with a 1.2 runtime is required, the minimum
 * version may be set to 120.
 *
 * Note that this is a compile-time setting, and so affects linking against
 * a particular SDK version rather than the versioning of the loaded runtime.
 *
 * The earlier versions of the header included basic vector and string 
 * classes based loosely on STL versions. These were difficult to 
 * maintain and very rarely used. For the 2.0 header we now assume
 * the presence of the standard library unless requested otherwise.
 * We use std::array, std::vector, std::shared_ptr and std::string 
 * throughout to safely manage memory and reduce the chance of a 
 * recurrance of earlier memory management bugs.
 *
 * These classes are used through typedefs in the cl namespace: 
 * cl::array, cl::vector, cl::pointer and cl::string.
 * In addition cl::allocate_pointer forwards to std::allocate_shared
 * by default.
 * In all cases these standard library classes can be replaced with 
 * custom interface-compatible versions using the CL_HPP_NO_STD_ARRAY, 
 * CL_HPP_NO_STD_VECTOR, CL_HPP_NO_STD_UNIQUE_PTR and 
 * CL_HPP_NO_STD_STRING macros.
 *
 * The OpenCL 1.x versions of the C++ bindings included a size_t wrapper
 * class to interface with kernel enqueue. This caused unpleasant interactions
 * with the standard size_t declaration and led to namespacing bugs.
 * In the 2.0 version we have replaced this with a std::array-based interface.
 * However, the old behaviour can be regained for backward compatibility
 * using the CL_HPP_ENABLE_SIZE_T_COMPATIBILITY macro.
 *
 * Finally, the program construction interface used a clumsy vector-of-pairs
 * design in the earlier versions. We have replaced that with a cleaner 
 * vector-of-vectors and vector-of-strings design. However, for backward 
 * compatibility old behaviour can be regained with the
 * CL_HPP_ENABLE_PROGRAM_CONSTRUCTION_FROM_ARRAY_COMPATIBILITY macro.
 * 
 * In OpenCL 2.0 OpenCL C is not entirely backward compatibility with 
 * earlier versions. As a result a flag must be passed to the OpenCL C
 * compiled to request OpenCL 2.0 compilation of kernels with 1.2 as
 * the default in the absence of the flag.
 * In some cases the C++ bindings automatically compile code for ease.
 * For those cases the compilation defaults to OpenCL C 2.0.
 * If this is not wanted, the CL_HPP_CL_1_2_DEFAULT_BUILD macro may
 * be specified to assume 1.2 compilation.
 * If more fine-grained decisions on a per-kernel bases are required
 * then explicit build operations that take the flag should be used.
 *
 *
 * \section parameterization Parameters
 * This header may be parameterized by a set of preprocessor macros.
 *
 * - CL_HPP_TARGET_OPENCL_VERSION
 *
 *   Defines the target OpenCL runtime version to build the header
 *   against. Defaults to 200, representing OpenCL 2.0.
 *
 * - CL_HPP_NO_STD_STRING
 *
 *   Do not use the standard library string class. cl::string is not
 *   defined and may be defined by the user before cl2.hpp is
 *   included.
 *
 * - CL_HPP_NO_STD_VECTOR
 *
 *   Do not use the standard library vector class. cl::vector is not
 *   defined and may be defined by the user before cl2.hpp is
 *   included.
 *
 * - CL_HPP_NO_STD_ARRAY
 *
 *   Do not use the standard library array class. cl::array is not
 *   defined and may be defined by the user before cl2.hpp is
 *   included.
 *
 * - CL_HPP_NO_STD_UNIQUE_PTR
 *
 *   Do not use the standard library unique_ptr class. cl::pointer and
 *   the cl::allocate_pointer functions are not defined and may be
 *   defined by the user before cl2.hpp is included.
 *
 * - CL_HPP_ENABLE_DEVICE_FISSION
 *
 *   Enables device fission for OpenCL 1.2 platforms.
 *
 * - CL_HPP_ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS
 *
 *   Enable exceptions for use in the C++ bindings header. This is the
 *   preferred error handling mechanism but is not required.
 *
 * - CL_HPP_ENABLE_SIZE_T_COMPATIBILITY
 *
 *   Backward compatibility option to support cl.hpp-style size_t
 *   class.  Replaces the updated std::array derived version and
 *   removal of size_t from the namespace. Note that in this case the
 *   new size_t class is placed in the cl::compatibility namespace and
 *   thus requires an additional using declaration for direct backward
 *   compatibility.
 *
 * - CL_HPP_ENABLE_PROGRAM_CONSTRUCTION_FROM_ARRAY_COMPATIBILITY
 *
 *   Enable older vector of pairs interface for construction of
 *   programs.
 *
 * - CL_HPP_CL_1_2_DEFAULT_BUILD
 *
 *   Default to OpenCL C 1.2 compilation rather than OpenCL C 2.0
 *   applies to use of cl::Program construction and other program
 *   build variants.
 *
 *
 * \section example Example
 *
 * The following example shows a general use case for the C++
 * bindings, including support for the optional exception feature and
 * also the supplied vector and string classes, see following sections for
 * decriptions of these
